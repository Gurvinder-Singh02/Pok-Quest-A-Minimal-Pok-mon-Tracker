# PokéQuest: A Minimal Pokémon Tracker

## Description
PokéQuest is a lightweight web application that allows users to search and explore various Pokémon data through the PokeAPI. The goal of this project is to create a seamless experience for Pokémon enthusiasts to quickly access Pokémon information.

## Thought Process
During the development of PokéQuest, I aimed to create a minimalistic interface that prioritizes user experience. The project started with brainstorming sessions where I focused on the core functionalities I wanted to include, such as searching for Pokémon, viewing their details, and organizing the information in a visually appealing way.


## API Integration
The application utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pokémon data. The API provides a wide range of information, including Pokémon attributes, types, abilities, and much more. The key endpoints used in the application are:
- `/pokemon`: For retrieving basic Pokémon information.
- `/type`: To get details about different Pokémon types.

### How It Works
1. The user enters a Pokémon name or ID in the search bar.
2. The application makes an API call to PokeAPI to retrieve data related to the entered Pokémon.
3. The fetched data is then displayed in a user-friendly format, allowing users to explore various attributes.

## Shout-Out to PokeAPI
A special thanks to [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for providing an amazing API that made this project possible. Their extensive database allowed me to focus on creating a great user experience rather than building a backend from scratch.
